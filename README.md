# zkSolvencyFHE: A Privacy-Enhanced DeFi Lending Protocol

zkSolvencyFHE is a pioneering DeFi lending protocol that leverages **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption technology** to offer privacy-centric borrowing solutions. By allowing borrowers to submit zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs of solvency without revealing specific collateral details, this protocol introduces a new paradigm in decentralized finance—one where privacy and security are paramount.

## The Problem We're Solving

In the traditional DeFi landscape, borrowers are often required to disclose detailed information about their collateral to access loans. This leads to concerns about privacy and data security, deterring users from utilizing DeFi services. Moreover, the existing models may not cater to individuals without substantial collateral, limiting access to loans for many prospective users.

## How FHE Provides the Solution

zkSolvencyFHE addresses these challenges through the innovative use of **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)**. By implementing Zama's open-source libraries, such as **Concrete** and **TFHE-rs**, our protocol allows users to generate a ZK proof indicating that their assets exceed their liabilities without revealing any sensitive information. This seamless integration of privacy-preserving technology fosters trust and security among users, encouraging broader participation in the DeFi ecosystem.

## Core Functionalities

- **Privacy-Preserving Proof Generation:** Users can submit a proof showing their solvency without disclosing any actual asset amounts.
- **No Collateral Required:** Borrowers can access loans without needing to provide detailed collateral information, making lending more accessible.
- **Secure and Efficient Transactions:** The combination of ZK proofs and FHE ensures that all transactions are secure and efficient while maintaining user confidentiality.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** A simple loan application interface enables users to easily submit their solvency proofs.

## Technology Stack

The zkSolvencyFHE protocol is built on a robust technology stack that includes:
- **Zama's FHE SDK** (Concrete and TFHE-rs)
- **Solidity** for smart contract development
- **Node.js** for backend services
- **Hardhat** for development workflow and testing

## Directory Structure

Here’s how the project directory is organized:

```
/zkSolvencyFHE
├── contracts
│   └── zkSolvencyFHE.sol
├── scripts
│   └── deploy.js
├── test
│   └── zkSolvencyFHE.test.js
├── package.json
└── README.md
```

## Getting Started

To set up the project locally, first ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- **Node.js** (version 14 or later)
- **Hardhat** or **Foundry** for smart contract development and testing

### Installation Steps

1. Download the project files.
2. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command to install all required dependencies, including Zama FHE libraries:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

> **Important:** Do not use `git clone` or any URLs to download this project.

## Build & Run the Protocol

Once the installation is complete, you can build and run the zkSolvencyFHE protocol by following these commands:

### Compile the Smart Contracts

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

### Run Tests

To ensure that everything is functioning as expected, execute the tests:

```bash
npx hardhat test
```

### Deploy the Contract

To deploy the smart contract to a local blockchain network, use:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

## Example Usage

Here's a brief example demonstrating how a user could generate a ZK proof of solvency and use it to request a loan:

```javascript
const { generateZKProof } = require('zkSolvencyFHE');

async function requestLoan(userId, assetValue, debtValue) {
    const isSolvent = assetValue > debtValue;
    if (isSolvent) {
        const proof = await generateZKProof(userId, assetValue, debtValue);
        // Submit the proof to the loan application interface
        console.log(`Successfully generated ZK proof: ${proof}`);
        // Loan request code goes here
    } else {
        console.error('User is not solvent for the requested loan.');
    }
}
```
